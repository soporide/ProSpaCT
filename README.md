# ProSpaCT: A Probabilistic Spatiotemporal Graph Transformer for Calibrated Risk Forecasting in Cyber-Physical Systems

Abstract: Organizations operating cyber-physical systems (CPS) require risk forecasts that remain reliable as network conditions evolve. We propose ProSpaCT, a Probabilistic Spatiotemporal-graph Calibrated Transformer that delivers calibrated and stable risk estimates for dynamic, multi-layer CPS networks. ProSpaCT introduces three advances. First, it learns adaptive mesoscale partitions that track structural reconfiguration and preserve coherent functional zones, enabling accurate representation of multi-hop exposure pathways and transient coalitions. Second, it employs a hierarchical spatiotemporal encoder that integrates within-patch, cross-patch, and temporal information using scalable linearized attention, supporting real-time inference without sacrificing long-range dependency coverage. Third, incorporates a probabilistic head that combines global temperature scaling, patch-level Beta posteriors, and logit-space shrinkage to produce calibrated probabilities and uncertainty intervals even under irregular sensing and distributional shift. Evaluated on multilayer CPS telemetry, ProSpaCT outperforms dynamic graph and transformer baselines in proper scoring, calibration error, lead-time, coalition recovery, and multi-hop exposure prioritization, while maintaining operational throughput. Its calibrated outputs transfer across episodes, allowing managers to apply a single threshold that yields stable false-positive rates and supports decisions involving triage, queue management, resource pre-positioning, and contingency planning. By unifying structural adaptivity, hierarchical spatiotemporal reasoning, and uncertainty-aware prediction, ProSpaCT advances CPS risk forecasting from retrospective anomaly detection to predictive, decision-oriented intelligence for dynamic operational environments.
